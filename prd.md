# Markdown Inspector - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Markdown Inspector is a command-line tool designed to analyze markdown files based on predefined configuration files. The initial version focuses on validating markdown header structures (existence, order, and hierarchy) against expected formats defined in JSON configuration files.

## Problem Statement

Documentation in markdown format often needs to follow specific structural guidelines, especially in enterprise environments. Manually inspecting these documents for compliance is time-consuming and error-prone. The Markdown Inspector automates this verification process.

## Target Users

- Documentation engineers
- Technical writers
- Development teams with documentation standards
- CI/CD pipelines for documentation verification

## Key Features

### 1. Header Structure Validation

- Verify that required headers exist in markdown files
- Check that headers appear in the correct order
- Validate header levels match the expected hierarchy
- Produce clear pass/fail results for validation checks

### 2. Configuration-based Analysis

- Use JSON configuration files to define expected document structures
- Support multiple configuration file formats
- Allow for different document templates (architecture, user, operations docs)

### 3. CLI Interface

- Accept markdown file path as input
- Accept configuration file path as input
- Provide clear, actionable output for validation failures
- Return appropriate exit codes for pipeline integration

## Technical Requirements

### Command-line Interface

```bash
markdowninspector --config <config_file.json> --target <markdown_file.md>
```

Options:

- `--config`: Path to the JSON configuration file
- `--target`: Path to the markdown file to inspect
- `--verbose`: Optional flag to provide detailed output
- `--output-format`: Optional parameter to specify output format (text, json, etc.)

### Configuration File Format

JSON files defining required document structure, example:

```json
{
  "headings": [
    {
      "title": "Document Title",
      "level": 1
    },
    {
      "title": "Section Header",
      "level": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output Format

- Success: Exit code 0, confirmation message
- Failure: Non-zero exit code, list of validation errors
  - Missing headers
  - Incorrect header order
  - Wrong header level

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 - Header Analysis MVP

- Develop core functionality to parse markdown and configuration files
- Implement header validation logic
- Create basic CLI interface
- Develop test suite with sample files

### Future Enhancements

- Content requirements beyond headers
- Link validation
- Image reference validation
- Support for partial matches and "suggested" vs "required" elements

## Testing

Test cases should include:

- Validation against files with correct headers
- Validation against files with missing headers
- Validation against files with correct headers in wrong order
- Validation against files with incorrect header levels

## Success Metrics

- Successful detection of 100% of header structure violations
- Clear, actionable output that guides users to correct issues
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated document validation
